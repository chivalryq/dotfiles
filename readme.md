# chivalryq's dotfiles

This is where I store my dotfiles. I'm currently Using

- [Neovim](./config/nvim/)
- [tmux](./.tmux.conf)
- [yabi](./.yabairc) and shkd
- Karabiner-Elements for keyboard customization

Currently I'm configing my nvim to be good enough for Go development.

Probably Always WIP :D
